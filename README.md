Hi sir
As the part of the data analyst internship task 1, i cleaned and preprocessed the "customer Personality Analysis" data set. In the dataset there where missing values, inconsistent formatting.
In the first step i checked for missing and zero-like values and removed them if found
in the step two for removing duplicate i used the remove duplicate function
in the step three i fixed the inconsistent cases in columns, ensured unifrom values for categorical feilds
in step four converted the date formate to the uniform format as specified
in step five i renamed all the columns to lowercase and replaced spaces with the underscores
in step six i ensured numeric feilds were properly formatted as numbers and data columns were formatted as actual date type.
